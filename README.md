# stacks-using-singly-linked-list
Stack Implementation using Singly Linked List
This C program implements a stack data structure using a singly linked list. Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

Key Features:

Insertion (Push): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Deletion (Pop): Removes the topmost element from the stack.
Display: Prints the elements of the stack in the order from top to bottom.
Stack Overflow/Underflow Handling: Prevents the stack from exceeding its maximum size or becoming empty.
